# This is a multi-stage build to optimize image size.

# 1) First, we build the base image to have it cached on rebuilds:
FROM node:12 AS base

# Create app directory
WORKDIR /usr/app

# Add Tini to increase container stability / https://github.com/krallin/tini
ENV TINI_VERSION v0.18.0
ENV TINI_GPG_KEY 595E85A6B1B4779EA4DAAEC70B588DFF0527A9B7
ADD https://github.com/krallin/tini/releases/download/${TINI_VERSION}/tini /tini
ADD https://github.com/krallin/tini/releases/download/${TINI_VERSION}/tini.asc /tini.asc

# Try multiple keyservers to stabilize build failure rate
# Also disable IPv6: https://github.com/inversepath/usbarmory-debian-base_image/issues/9

# TODO: Add PGP public keys in docker container directly as the keyserver connection is flaky.
# This is a single point of failure for many container based build processes currently, GitHub is
# full of issues about this.

RUN mkdir -p ~/.gnupg && echo "disable-ipv6" >> ~/.gnupg/dirmngr.conf \
  && \
  ( \
  gpg --keyserver hkp://pgp.mit.edu:80 --recv-keys "$TINI_GPG_KEY" ||\
  gpg --keyserver hkp://p80.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 --recv-keys "$TINI_GPG_KEY" || \
  gpg --keyserver hkp://ipv4.pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys "$TINI_GPG_KEY" \
  ) \
  && gpg --batch --verify /tini.asc /tini

RUN chmod +x /tini
# Set tini as entrypoint. Tini will watch over the child process defined via `CMD â€¦` below and
# restart it if it crashes.
ENTRYPOINT ["/tini", "--"]

# Cache necessary files for npm install
COPY package.json .
COPY package-lock.json .

# 2) Now we create a new image in which we install dependencies necessary for building our app.
#    This will create a lot of clutter that we don't want to include in our final image to push.
FROM base AS buildenv
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
  ca-certificates \
  g++ \
  build-essential \
  make \
  gnupg2 \
  && apt-get clean \
  && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

RUN npm set progress=false && npm config set depth 0
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN touch .env && NODE_ENV=production npm run build && npm prune --production && rm -rf ./node_modules/.cache

# run linters, setup and tests
# FROM buildenv AS test
# COPY . .
# RUN  npm run lint && npm run setup && npm run test

# 3) The build is done! Now we create a third image, based on the base image from the beginning.
#    In this third image, we extract only the minimal necessary set of files to run the app. The
#    result is what we will push to the registry.
